Walsh\"></p>\n<p>“Within 10 minutes, we had our environment set up, with the website building and deploying,” said Matthew Crist, lead engineer for the project.</p>\n<p>With Gatsby, the team was able to complete the website from basic comps in around a week, compared to about a month for similar projects in the past. “We generally haven’t been able to do anything as fast,” Crist said.</p>\n<p>As an engineer, Crist really appreciated Gatsby’s out-of-the-box hot reloading support.\n“The fact that you can save your code, tab back to your browser, and see the change sped up development so much,” Crist said.</p>\n<p>And the whole team appreciated Gatsby’s support for component libraries.</p>\n<p>“We were able to use our pattern library that we’ve built for Boston.gov,” said Crist. “Our city’s website is nothing but components, stacked together to create a page. <a href=\"http://amazon.boston.gov\">amazon.boston.gov</a> is the same.”</p>\n<p>“Our pattern library has already been A/B tested, and stakeholders are already bought in,” said Crystal Torman, an economic development advisor for Boston, and the project’s internal client. “We could make just one decision about website styling and then spend more time drilling into the content.”</p>\n<p>“Crystal and I were probably on the phone straight for two days, giving feedback,” said Reilly Zlab, the product manager.</p>\n<p>“Normally we don’t do so many iterations in such a short time,” laughs Torman.</p>\n<p><img src=\"./amazon-boston-2.jpg\" alt=\"Amazon Boston homepage\" title=\"Boston city\"></p>\n<p>The iterations paid off.</p>\n<p>“Both internally and externally we’ve heard overwhelmingly positive feedback,” Torman says. “People here love the website.”</p>\n<p>Apparently, so did Amazon.</p>","excerpt":"Boston.gov  is a small team with a huge responsibility: ten people tasked with the digital presence of New England’s most iconic city.
