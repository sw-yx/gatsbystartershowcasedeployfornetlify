Along the way, we’ll introduce a few more plugins you’ll often want to use in your Gatsby sites.</p>\n<h2 id=\"lighthouse\"><a href=\"#lighthouse\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Lighthouse</h2>\n<p>Quoting from the Lighthouse website:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Lighthouse is an open-source, automated tool for improving the quality of web pages. You can run it against any web page, public or requiring authentication. It has audits for performance, accessibility, progressive web apps, and more.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Lighthouse is included as part of Chrome DevTools. Running its audit and fixing problems it finds is a great way to prepare your site to go live because it helps give you confidence that your site is as fast and accessible as possible.</p>\n<p>Let’s try it out!</p>\n<p>First you need to create a production build of your Gatsby site. The Gatsby development server is optimized for making development fast but the site that it generates, while it closely resembles a production version of the site, isn’t as optimized.</p>\n<p>Stop the development server (if it’s still running) and run:</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">gatsby build</code></p>\n<p>As you learned in part 1 of the tutorial, this does a production build\nof your site and outputs the built static files into the <code class=\"language-text\">public</code> directory.</p>\n<p>To view the production site locally run:</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">gatsby serve</code></p>\n<p>Once this starts, you can now view your site at <code class=\"language-text\">localhost:9000</code>.</p>\n<p>Now let’s run your first Lighthouse test. To do so, open the site in Chrome (if you didn’t already do so) and then open up the Chrome DevTools. Now click on the “Audits” tab where you’ll see a screen that looks like:</p>\n<p><img src=\"./lighthouse-audit.png\" alt=\"Lighthouse audit start\"></p>\n<p>Click “Perform an audit…” then “Run audit”. It’ll then take a minute or so to run the audit.</p>\n<p>Once you’re done, you should see results that look like:</p>\n<p><img src=\"./lighthouse-audit-results.png\" alt=\"Lighthouse audit results\"></p>\n<p>As you can see, Gatsby’s performance is excellent out of the box but we’re missing some things for PWA, Accessibility, Best Practices, and SEO that will improve your scores (and in the process make your site much more friendly to visitors and search engines).</p>\n<p>Let’s go through them.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>gatsby-plugin-manifest</li>\n<li>gatsby-plugin-offline</li>\n<li>add html/title/description.</li>\n</ul>","excerpt":"Wow!
