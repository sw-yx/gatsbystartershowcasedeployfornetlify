{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>In April and May, we hosted 2-day Gatsby workshops in both San Francisco and NYC and want to share what we learned and resources you can use to host your own Gatsby workshops. A big thank you to all the developers who came to these workshops, and another big thank you to Ryan Florence for organizing the workshop logistics; check out his company’s website at <a href=\"https://workshop.me/\">workshop.me</a>. Ryan has been an awesome supporter of Gatsby and a longtime fan, so yes, the workshop.me site is built on Gatsby :).</p>\n<p>We will keep improving these workshops and hope you’ll help us do that!

(Note: we used the main <a href=\"/tutorial/\">tutorials</a> in the workshops, so edits and improvements to the tutorials also improve the workshop)</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Good first issue</em>: <a href=\"https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/5608\">Emphasize file names</a> with (bold, italics, headers, or some other way) when people copy and paste code, because it’s easy to miss <em>where</em> you’re supposed to paste it with the current format</li>\n<li><em>Good first issue</em>: Make it clear in tutorial part 0 and workshops that all instructions are built assuming that you have installed <a href=\"https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/5610\">VS Code and Prettier</a> because those work well with React</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/5030\">Add a copy button to code examples</a> because people often missed backticks if their screen resolution didn’t make the ticks very visible</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We loved hosting workshops and plan to keep developing the resources as we learn. We’re so grateful for the workshop attendees and their feedback.</p>\n<p>And just as a reminder: we will keep improving these workshops and hope you’ll help us do that!
